## Do I have what it takes to write code?

In the past year, I had a good amount of time to reflect what it means to write code and what it means to write good code. I think it will be quite fun to share what I learned emotionally about coding throughout the year. First, I want to point out that everyone can code. Coding is not an innate ability that you have or not have. It is a skill that can be developed through patience by people with any learning style, personality, or background. Different people like different learning style, but of course, mine is the BEST. LEARNING STYLE. EVER. Well, because my learning style is so good, I think I should keep it to myself. Rather than tell you about my learning style, I will tell you about myself.

## Self-Reflection Part I: Overcoming the fear of coding

When I do programming problems whether in homework or in outside competitions, I often have this feeling that I know how to solve the problem, but I don’t want to implement the solution. I do not want to write the code or compile it. There is always an intense push back against my intention to write code. Sometimes such push back also happens even before I decide to write code. When I think I want to write code, it becomes much harder for me to focus. This often leads to me panicking. I will just give up and rest, or I will try my best to work, but with by ability to write programs half-impaired. One feature of this weird emotion that is pushing back against me is that it only happens when I don’t feel very confident writing the code. If I am very confident that I can write the code correctly, then this push back does not occur. Because of this, I speculate that the mysterious emotion was my fear of writing code incorrectly, which can be broken down into four different parts:

1.	the fear that I will put so much effort into my work but it will go to waste
2.	the fear that I will have to put in more effort and start over from zero
3.	the fear that I will be wrong.
4.	the fear that I am incompetent.

Number (1) and (2) make some sense to me. When I put in some effort, don’t want my effort to go to waste. I want my effort to bear fruit. Writing code correctly in the first try allows to avoid debugging the code afterwards. Debugging drains much more energy and take more time than coding so it makes sense I would try my best to avoid it. Viewed in this light, fear is my body’s defense mechanism for me to avoid debugging. However, if this is the case, then the solution would be quite straightforward. If such fear occurs to me next time, then I should appreciate what my body tells me and revise my ideas so that I understand them deeply so that I feel confident implementing.

However, there will be time when the codebase is so large or so complex that it is impossible to be confident about the idea or code I am about to contribute. Sometimes, there are many intertwining parts that makes the code too hard to read. In that case, I think the best bet is to try to run the portion of the code I want to understand in isolation within a debugger. Asking for help and explanation from others might also be a good idea. If that does not help, I might try sitting down for an hour or a day theorizing what the intention of the code and what its underlying mathematical foundations are.

Here, fear number (1) and (2) can be casted to a category of productive fear. It is a fear that force me to understand my ideas deeply and clearly before I start implementing. It is rather a healthy fear if I keep it in check.

Now number (3) and (4) seems a bit problematic for me. I see it quite amusing that my fear of being wrong or being incompetent can impede my ability to think clearly. Is this some version of imposter syndrome I’m having? Such line of explanation is quite plausible. The problem might be that I maintain a self-image which acclaims that I write good and correct code, that I can write better and more accurate code than others. I also notice I like to give off such (often inaccurate) impressions. Maybe such self-image and social expectations then become the reason I am afraid of doing it wrong. If this is the case, then I think I should drop such self-image and frame myself as something else. I should frame myself as a person who strives to write good and correct code and always tries my best to learn from mistakes which occurs rather frequently too. 

Another problem that is causing number (3) and (4) is that I am not very self-confident. I often measure my self-worth by my competency. If I cannot write a code that works, I might feel less worthy. This is partly be because I am in a weird financial situation where my future will depend on how competent I am. If I am not competent enough, I might have no choice for my future. I want to be worthy in the eyes of companies and grad schools. The other part of this is that I believe in meritocracy and capitalism, and such political beliefs requires me to produce for myself. Those beliefs judge me by my competency. 

Although I hope to shed away the idea that my worth is measured largely by competency and productivity, I might need some time for that to happen. It might require a radical change of mindset, and I don’t think that will happen quite soon. Unlike the other fears I have addressed, there might be no clean solution. Such idea might be necessary for me as a being. I think the workaround to this is for me to develop values and connections between me and the society by making more friends and doing more activities. As I make friends and connect with people, I hope I will find and develop new values which will overshadow my value for competency and productivity. Such value would then become my main source of self-esteem.

Turns out that a big part of my fear to write code is my fear of failure. There is a long journey ahead, and I am struggling very hard to do the things I mentioned. I have always been too stressed and tired to tackle my fears, but I will give myself time and do better next year.
