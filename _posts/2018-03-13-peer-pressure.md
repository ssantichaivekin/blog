It has been close to a year since I came to Harvey Mudd College. It's a very nice school. I love the people here. But there is is problem, and I think most people agree with this, that your friends are too good. By good I mean they are too far ahead of you and you barely see a way to catch up with them. My roommate has worked with NASA for two summer and Capital One for a summer. A person across the hallway is a International Physics Olympiad gold medalist who just turned his interest to CS. Many (most?) have already gotten a summer internship in tech companies. You kind of look at these people in awe and want to be like them.

The problem is, when you start comparing yourself with others, you can lose confidence in yourself. Let's see... umm... I don't attend "making apps" hackathons that often.... ummm... no project experience. Actually I did a project with my friends... it didn't go that well. Ummm... I do competitive programming but I'm a slow programmer so it didn't work out well.

This sometimes leads to "I think I won't pass this interview. It's impossible." I guess I won't go to the career fair. I'm an international student and they don't hire international students that much. I won't get a job anyway.

This kind of pressure is crippling, especially when I was studying Chinese and doing WRIT1 class last semester. Back then, I know that I am lacking, but I don't have time to catch up. The pressure is more intense when it's a small school and you feel close to many people. The question "what are you doing this summer" got brought up every once in a while, and people care about it here more than anywhere else.

I actually don't like bringing up such topics (unless I am confident that it will not upset anyone), but because I am very interested in algorithms and data structures, when someone talks about interview problems or personal projects, I enthusiastically join them even though it might upset someone (say non-CS major or people who are not job-hunting). This makes me feel a bit guilty, although people say I shouldn't think about it too much.

Well, it's much better this semester now that I am only taking 15 credits and have so much free time to do stuffs to catch up with them. The good side of peer pressure is that is prompts me to catch up with my freinds. It helps me ask for help from the experts and self-studied bash, github, jekyll, and some python during free time. I think it is through this kind of pressure that forces HMC students to be one of the best.

I guess I will have to learn to care less. I hope I will have a lot of free time next semester.
