I've seen many international students strive to find a tech internship or research to do in the summer. However, we all know that it is harder for international students. Even harder for international freshman. Truth be told, although I am writing this, I haven't got an internship either. But I have got some interviews. Just a few. Three to be excact. But many people haven't got any interview even though they tried hard. So I feel like I am a bit better off. I feel like I can help my friends. I guess if you are lucky, just a few tech interviews might be enough.

Throughout this post, I will tell you many things that I consider to be helpful and important. I will recommend you to do personal or group projects, take up a TA position, do hackathons or competitive programming, and other things. But you should always remember that what you do is not as important as how you think. Mindset is the most important thing here. It will help lead you to the right place, the right activity, and, if you are lucky, the freshman internship.

Read more about mindsets [here](from-radon) and [here](from-kws).

Also, although I am trying to write for international students, this applies to all freshmen, actaully all people who are looking for their first tech internship. This guide is extremely subjective, and it is intended to be that way, partly because I believe that a subjective advice (like "you should go to hackathons") is more useful than no advice (like not making real advice and say "good luck on the career fair").

This article is devoted to [KorlaMarch](korlamarch-github).

## Motivation

Well, I will just assume that you want an internship. I don't know why. People have different reasons. My reason is that my senior pressured me to get one. Some of my friends feel, I guess, inferior when they are going for CS major and have nothing to do in the summer. (Well, this is Harvey Mudd so...) Most think they will learn a lot from the internship, that it will be a good life experience. I think few, but some, are doing it for money. 

I will tell you this. I don't care why you want to do tech internship. I don't care how legit your reasons are. Just know that I want to help you.

## Zeroth Step: Know Where You Can Find Help

Go to your school's career services if your school have one, and it should. They will be able to help you. 
You should ask for their walk-in hours if they so have that. Ask them everything you want about career fair. Also ask them what you are supposed to ask. The career services, together with your school writing center, will be the place and the people who will help you proofread your resumes and cover letters. It is very important to have people help you draft and read your resumes and cover letters, especially if you are an international students.

There is also another (secret) resource I want to tell you. That is, the upperclassmen you admire. If you think someone is very good at CS, ask them for advice. If you think someone is doing a really cool project, ask them how they came up with it. Ask them to recommend you a learning path. If you follow their learning path, you can ask them for help!

Also, of course you can ask me, but the best I can do is point you to people who are more helpful.

## First Step: But what is a tech internship?

You are applying for a software development internship. It's almost always software development. What does that mean? Okay. Let's look at what what they are looking for. The list is ordered by increasing importance. (Of course it is subjective!)

But first, let's first think about what they are not looking for:
- Enthusiasm in cooking.
- How well you play skateboard.
- The fact that you like to eat cookies.
- Word/Powerpoint/Photoshop skills.
- LaTex.
- Painting skills.
- Your reading club.
- Math. If you are good at math, then that's a plus. But they are not definitely not looking at your great abstract algebra or topology skills.
- Grades. They do look at your grades. But as long as it's not too bad, it's fine.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't put those in your resume. But if you do, don't try to hilight it.

Okay, now let's look at something that would be quite helpful:
- Public Speaking skills.
- Other language skills. It's good that you can speak multiple languages.
- Community Service.
- Participation in underrepresented community group activities.
- The club that you founded.
- Graphic Design Skills. If you are familiar with graphic designs, then that might be a plus, but it depends.
- Robotics or engineering projects.
- Competitive Programming. If you are good at competitive programming, that's cool, except if you write int a,b,c,d,e,f,g at the start of every program. Basically, competitive programming is a big plus, but only if you also can explain algorithms to a normal decent human being.

I should say that these things are really good. If you have more than five of the things listed above, you could easily get into Facebook University or Microsoft Explore program.

Now let's look at the thing I believe they are really looking for:
- Your previous jobs. By this, I mean anything that pays.
- TA experience in CS class.
- Programming Languages you can write. The more, the better. If you know some Python and want to learn a second language, I would recommend you (and I think this is controversial) to go for Bash.
- Git.
- Framework you can use. (the more, the better)
- Software development hackathons.
- Knowledge in data structures.
- Previous research experience.
- Personal programming projects.
- Team programming projects.

Note that for international students, they often also look for proficiency in English. This does not mean your TOEFL score, but rather that you can communicate well in career fair in interviews.

## Second Step: Know Yourself - Write a Resume

My first advice is to not claim something you cannot do. Basically, I wrote that I was familiar with C in my resume, so my interviewer became interested and ask me to implement a problem in C.

## Third Step: Tech Interview

## Third Step: Improve Yourself



## Extra: But why am I in such a rush?

After reading all this, you might still think finding internship in the first year is still unnecessary. I guess I will have to tell you my own secret.

Whisper: Well, if you are like me, and I hope you are not, you will graduate with around four hundred thousand dollars of debt. Again, I hope you are not, but if you are, you will have to find a job that will pay for your debt. And if economic independence is one of your goal, you will want to find a well-paying job that will get you out of your debt fast.

So basically, I want to make sure I have a job after I graduate.

Whisper: Exchange-student (J-1) visa holders are even less likely to be hired, and I'm holding that kind of visa. Two of my friends got their internship offers cancled just when the employer knows that they are holding J-1. Of course, the company won't tell you that's the reason, and, of course, the career services would not help you if this kind of thing happens.

Whisper: The reason recruiters do not like J-1 is because a J-1 holder can only work for two years after graduation. After that, they are not allowed to stay in the US until they go back to their home country for two years. Although there some ways to get around this, say, work in Canada to pay off the debt before returning to the home country, it does not happen a lot.

So you see, a job is more important for me because it is harder for me to secure one. I also have to try harder for internship beacuse I know that unexpected surprise can happen (say, Mike Pence becomes the next president).

## Extra 2:

Microsoft called me (unofficailly) that I got the internship just the day I started writing this. So I guess my article is more legit now.
