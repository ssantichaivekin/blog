I've seen many international students strive to find a tech internship or research to do in the summer. However, we all know that it is harder for international students. Even harder for international freshman. Truth be told, although I am writing this, I haven't got an internship either. But I have got some interviews. Just a few. Three to be excact. But many people haven't got any interview even though they tried hard. So I feel like I am a bit better off. I feel like I can help my friends. I guess if you are lucky, just a few tech interviews might be enough.

Throughout this post, I will tell you many things that I consider to be helpful and important. I will recommend you to do personal or group projects, take up a TA position, do hackathons or competitive programming, and other things. But you should always remember that what you do is not as important as how you think. Mindset is the most important thing here.

## Motivation

Why is internship important? Why is it harder for international students, and why is it even harder for international students holding J-1 visa?



## Know yourself
