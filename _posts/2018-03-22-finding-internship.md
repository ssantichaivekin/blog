I've seen many international students strive to find a tech internship or research to do in the summer. However, we all know that it is harder for international students, and even harder for international freshman. Truth be told, although I am writing this, I haven't got an internship either. But I have got some interviews. Just a few. Three to be excact. But many people haven't got any interview even though they tried hard. So I feel like I am a bit better off. I feel like I can help my friends. I guess if you are lucky, just a few tech interviews might be enough for you.

Throughout this post, I will tell you many things that I consider to be helpful and important. I will recommend you to do personal or group projects, take up a TA position, do hackathons or competitive programming, and other things. But you should always remember that what you do is not as important as how you think. Mindset is the most important thing here. It will help lead you to the right place, the right activity, and, if you are lucky, the freshman internship.

Read more about that [here][from-radon] and [here][from-kws] (link still broken).

Also, although I am trying to write for international freshmen, this applies to all freshmen, or all international students who are looking for their first tech internship. This guide is extremely subjective, and it is intended to be that way, partly because I believe that a subjective advice (like "you should go do hackathons") is more useful than no advice (like "good luck on the career fair").

## Motivation

Well, I will just assume that you want an internship. I don't know why. People have different reasons. My reason is that a senior pressured me to get one. Some of my friends feel, I guess, inferior when they are going for CS major and have nothing to do in the summer. (Well, this is Harvey Mudd so...) Most think they will learn a lot from the internship. They think it will be a good life experience. I believe few, but some, are doing it mainly for money. 

I will tell you this. I don't care why you want to do tech internship. I don't care how legit your reasons are. Just know that I want to help you.

## Zeroth Step: Know Where You Can Find Help

Go to your school's career services. They will be able to help you. 
You should ask for their walk-in hours if they have one. Ask them everything you want about career fair. Also ask them what you are supposed to ask. The career services, together with your school writing center, will be the place and the people who will help you proofread your resumes and cover letters. It is very important to have people help you draft and read your resumes and cover letters, especially if you are an international student.

There is also another resource I want to tell you. It is the upperclassmen you admire. If you think someone is very good at CS, ask them for advice. If you think someone is doing a really cool project, ask them how they came up with it. Ask them to recommend you a learning path. If you follow their learning path, you can ask them for help!

Also, of course you can ask me, but the best I can do is point you to people who are more helpful.

## First Step: But what is a tech internship?

You are applying for a software development internship. It's almost always software development. What does that mean? Well, it means you are writing a software with a small team using source control. 

Okay. Let's look at what what they are looking for. The list is ordered by increasing importance. (The list is subjective!)

But first, let's first think about what they are not looking for:
- Enthusiasm in cooking.
- How well you play skateboard.
- The fact that you like to eat cookies.
- Word/Powerpoint/Photoshop skills.
- LaTex.
- Painting skills.
- Your clubs.
- Choir.
- Grades. They do look at your grades. But as long as it's not too bad, it's fine.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't put those in your resume. But if you do, don't try to hilight it. Put it in as a place holder.

Okay, now let's look at something that would be quite helpful:
- Math. If you are good at math, then that's a plus. But they definitely do not care about your abstract algebra or topology skills.
- Public Speaking skills.
- Other language skills. It's good that you can speak multiple languages.
- Community Service.
- Participation in underrepresented community group activities.
- The club that you founded.
- Your previous jobs. By this, I mean anything that pays.
- Graphic Design Skills. If you are familiar with graphic designs, then that might be a plus, but it depends.
- Robotics or engineering projects.
- Competitive Programming. If you are good at competitive programming, that's cool, except if you write int a,b,c,d,e,f,g at the start of every program, then not cool. Basically, competitive programming is a big plus, but only if you can explain algorithms to a normal decent human being.

These things are really cool. If you have four or more from the list above, you have a really good chance of getting into freshmen-only programs such as Facebook University or Microsoft Explore. If you don't have any, don't worry, it's not that important for the software development position.

Here's what they are looking for:
- Teaching Assistant experience in CS class, especially if it pays.
- Programming Languages you are confident in. Aim for two or more.
- Git/GitHub. Know how to use Git and have a GitHub account.
- Software development hackathons.
- Knowledge in data structures.
- Previous research experience.
- Personal programming projects.
- Team programming projects.

I you have four or more from the list above, then you are good to go. You are quite likely to get an internship. To be on the safer side, aim for five or six.

Note that for international students, they often also look for proficiency in English. This does not mean they will look at your TOEFL score, but rather that you can communicate well in career fair in interviews.

Also, freshmen-only internships generally require less technical knowledge. These are mostly held by big companies to promote their companies. For example, you are much likely to get an Engineering Practicum Intern at Google than a Software Engineer Intern at Dropbox. These programs will care more about your personal life, your high school clubs, and your community services. These programs also prefer people with underrepresented identities. Definitely apply if you are a woman, or LGBTQ, or is of an underrepresented race.

## Second Step: Know Yourself - Write a Resume

Well, look at the lists above and then just list out what you have done. After that, go to career services with the list. They will help you come up with a pretty good resume.

When you write your resume, be true to yourself. It is better to have short and relevant resume than long resume filled with with irrelevant things.

Take your time. Give yourself a week to write your resume. Don't rush. If you are like me, you did your CS projects in your home country, in your home language. If that is the case, it is better to try to recall those memories and write about it in your native language first, and then translate it later. If your memory is encrypted in your native language, it is much harder to retrieve it in English. In this sense, the people who will be the most helpful to you are your friends of upperclassmen from your home country.

Here is what my [first resume][first-resume] looks like.

[first-resume]: https://github.com/ssantichaivekin/blog/blob/master/assets/first-resume.pdf

Well, you might see that my resume is quite interesting, but definitely not very well written. If you are good at English, you can definitely rewrite my resume better than me. As you can see, my resume did not pass my own standard either, and that means I will have to improve.

Note that if you say you can write C in your resume, interviewers might ask you to write your code in C (or C-style psudocode). That happened to me.

I recommend that you go to career services to help you draft your first resume. If you think it looks good and it shows that you have the ability they are looking for, then you are good. Proofread the resume and submit. If that's the case, then generally you won't be reading my article. The problem most people face is that they do not have enough experience to secure an internship in the first place.

Also, some position will require a cover letter. The cover letter is not hard to write. There is an established template to follow. Just go to your school career services and ask for help. You should be able to finish it in less than an hour.

## Third Step: Improve Yourself

I have seen people, who, believing that they are already fit for internship positions, use their time to improve the resumes refuse to improve their techincal skills. That's why I write out the list very clearly and say that four items from the last list is a good standard you should aim for. (Three might be enough if you are of underrepresented identities.)

I can give you some recommendations on what you might want to try:

- Apply for CS Teaching Assistant in your second semester.
- Learn Bash and Git. I have [a good coursera course here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix). I think most Git tutorials on Google are good. I personally like Codeschool's tutorial. If you have a question about Git, go ask a CS upperclassman.
- Learn Javascript/HTML/CSS bundle (only if you want to work on JavaScript project).
- Go to software development hackathons. Spend the time to talk with people and learn from them.
- Do a personal project. Do something that matters to you. See [kosate.com](http://kosate.com) for web project ideas. You can look at [my github](https://github.com/ssantichaivekin) for a small python project. If you want some project ideas, you can ask me. I have a lot in my drawer.
- Start a team project with friends or club. Only do this if your friends are enthusiastic about it.

Of all the things listed, I think learning Git is the most important.

This seems like a lot, but you don't have to do all of it. Just choose one or two that you want to do. If you know me personally, you would know that I have chosen CS Teaching Assistant, learning Bash and Git, and doing a personal project. If you choose to do personal or groups projects, make sure that you make it well documented, in case the recruiter comes to look.

If you don't know what to choose, message me via Facebook.

Expect each thing in the list to take one to three months. Don't rush. They are hard. They are not hard because they are hard to understand, but they are hard because many of them include extremely painful and boring work. Learning a new computer language is like learning a new human language. You will take time to learn. You take time to adapt and think in such a way.

Some of you, after reading all this, will think that it is too much. If you are already tired and are reading this, rest, and come back again later. 

There is a quite unrelated quote I want to give you. Abraham Lincoln said that "You cannot now believe that you will ever feel better. But this is not true. You are sure to be happy again. Knowing this, truly believing it will make you less miserable now."
This is also true for self-improvement. Knowing that you will improve, and truely believing in it, will make you improve and learn better now.

## Forth Step: Tech Interview

Some freshmen-only programs do not have tech interview. I have heard that Facebook University doesn't have one. Instead, they have phone interviews and ask behavioral questions.

The best way to practice doing tech interview is being in one. Mock interviews are not as good as real interviews.

I can tell you a lot of things on tech interviews, but I think there are people who can tell better. Go check [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview), listen to their videos, and slove their problems. Also, check out the book Cracking the Coding Interview and go to your career services. Check out the videos and go to career services to practice interviews even though you know you can slove the problems. The hard is often the explanation, rather than the solution itself. 

Definitely check out the book!

Again, check out the book. The HMC career services have many copy of it.

## Don't Give Up

Contrary to the established idea that the recruiting season ends around Fall break, it actually ends at around the start of Spring break. There are less recruiting in the Spring, but there are less people applying. I believe it is generally easier to get in because all the best people have already been recruited. In this sense, Fall break and Winter break is the best time to improve yourself, work on personal projects, and learn new things. But don't force yourself too much. School is hard and you should rest a lot in the break.

However, be careful if you are applying to freshmen-only programs. Those programs generally get filled by the end of Fall semester.

## Bonus 0: List of company programs you should apply.

First-year oriented internships:

[Facebook University](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbu)
[Google Engineering Practicum Intern](https://careers.google.com/students/engineering-and-technical-internships/)
[Microsoft Explore](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en)

List of companies known to accept first year international students for their normal software engineering internships:

Microsoft
Facebook
Twitter
Airbnb
Yelp
Uber
Dropbox (hard)
Box (hard)
vmWare (hard)

There are, of course, a lot more companies that accept international freshmen internship. Please add it here if you know some.

Note that all of them have online applications. You can always apply online. It makes no difference whether you apply online or through career fairs.

## Bonus 1: But why am I in such a rush?

After reading all this, you might still think finding internship in the first year is still unnecessary. I guess I will have to tell you my own secret.

Whisper: Well, if you are like me, and I hope you are not, you will graduate with around four hundred thousand dollars of debt. Again, I hope you are not, but if you are, you will have to find a job that will pay for your debt. And if economic independence is one of your goal, you will want to find a well-paying job that will get you out of your debt fast.

So basically, I want to make sure I have a job after I graduate.

Whisper: Exchange-student (J-1) visa holders are even less likely to be hired, and I'm holding that kind of visa. Two of my friends got their internship offers cancled just when the employer knows that they are holding J-1. Of course, the company won't tell you that's the reason, and, of course, the career services would not help you if this kind of thing happens.

Whisper: The reason recruiters do not like J-1 is because a J-1 holder can only work for two years after graduation. After that, they are not allowed to stay in the US until they go back to their home country for two years. Although there some ways to get around this, say, work in Canada to pay off the debt before returning to the home country, it does not happen a lot.

So you see, a job is more important for me because it is harder for me to secure one. I also have to try harder for internship beacuse I know that unexpected surprise can happen (say, Mike Pence becomes the next president).

## Bonus 2:

You might think I am writing this with too much confident. How can I, who haven't got any internship either, help you? Well, Microsoft just called me (unofficailly) that I got the internship while I am finishing the post. So I guess my article is more legit now.
