I've seen many international students strive to find a tech internship or research to do in the summer. However, we all know that it is harder for international students. Even harder for international freshman. Truth be told, although I am writing this, I haven't got an internship either. But I have got some interviews. Just a few. Three to be excact. But many people haven't got any interview even though they tried hard. So I feel like I am a bit better off. I feel like I can help my friends. I guess if you are lucky, just a few tech interviews might be enough.

Throughout this post, I will tell you many things that I consider to be helpful and important. I will recommend you to do personal or group projects, take up a TA position, do hackathons or competitive programming, and other things. But you should always remember that what you do is not as important as how you think. Mindset is the most important thing here. It will help lead you to the right place, the right activity, and, if you are lucky, the right freshman internship.

## Motivation

Why is internship important? Why is it harder for international students, and why is it even harder for international students holding J-1 visa?

Well, if you are like me, and I hope you are not, you will graduate with around four hundred thousand dollars of debt. Again, I hope you are not, but if you are, you will have to find a job that will pay for your debt. And if economic independence is one of your goal, you will want to find a well-paying job that will get you out of your debt fast.

So basically, I want to make sure I have a job after I graduate.

You might be saying, well, what does that have to do with internships? I don't need internship to be able to land in a job? I think this is unnecessary pressure.

Well, I will have to tell you a secret. 

Whisper: Non-citizens are less likely to be hired.

Well, I guess that's partly beacuse our English is not as good as native speakers.

Why is tech intenship important? Well, most people are starting with an empty resume and not a lot of tech experience. By empty resume I mean hollow resume. There are substances, but not enough to make the resume wholesome, not enough to get you into an internship. But how do you make your resume wholesome? Well, the best way to show that you have experience is internship. If you have done some internship, then people know that you have experience.

Wait. What am I saying? Am I saying that one have to do a tech internship in order to get into a tech internship?

## Know yourself

## Why am I in such a rush?

After reading all this, you might still think that freshman internship is important to me.

You might still think finding internship in the first year is still too much. But I guess I will have to tell you my own secret. Please don't share it.

Whisper: Exchange-student (J-1) visa holders are even less likely to be hired, and I'm holding that kind of visa. Two of my friends got their internship offers cancled after the employer knows that they are holding J-1. Of course, the company won't tell you that that's the reason, and, of course, the career services would not help you if this kind of thing happens.

Whisper: The reason recruiters do not like J-1 is because a J-1 holder can only work for two years after graduation. After that, they are not allowed in the US until they stay in their home country for two years.

So you see, a job is more important to me because it is harder for me to secure one.
