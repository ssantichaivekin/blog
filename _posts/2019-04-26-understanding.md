## Self-reflection part II: What does it mean to understand?

I want to start this article with a big claim that everyone has a different concept of what understanding means. When someone says they understand how an algorithm works, they might by saying “I’m pretty sure I can implement the algorithm” or “I am confident I can use this algorithm to solve related problems” or “I think I will be able to do a problem on this algorithm on the exam” or “give me a day, I can write a proof of correctness of this algorithm for you” or “I can explain how it works to you right now” or all of the above. It is possible for a person to be able to explain how an algorithm works but cannot implement it correctly, and it is also possible for a person to be able to implement an algorithm correctly but cannot explain it to other people. These two kinds of people understand the algorithm differently, and not just to a different level. They have different concepts or benchmarks of understanding, and not just different level or qualities.

In my opinion, understanding can be divided in three categories:

1.	Understanding as the ability to reproduce. If someone understand physics, he can do physics problem. If someone understands drawing, he can draw. If someone can ride a bike, he understands how to ride a bike. To be fair, I’m rather bad at acquiring this kind of understanding. It seems to take me more than other people to learn to do new things. I have quite a bad memory and not very good motor skills, so I do not have the ability normal people have to understand by remembering and reproducing. 
2.	Understanding as the ability to internalize and see knowledge as natural or intuitive. Here’s if someone understand physics, then he would say that physics seems intuitive and natural to him. I’m very good at acquiring this kind of knowledge, although I do not know why. However, there is some problem about this kind of understanding. It is uncommon for me to believe that I understand something intuitively but later it turns out that I cannot use that knowledge to solve related problems nor explain it to other people. After that happens, I often realizes that I did not actually understand the idea intuitively after all. 
3.	Understanding as the ability to explain a concept to other people. Here, if I say that I understand an algorithm, it means that I know how to explain the knowledge to you in person with a whiteboard. I don’t have to be able to implement the algorithm myself, or at least I don’t have to be confident that I can.

A person’s concept of understanding affects how they learn. If a person thinks understanding is measured by doing, the person will lean by trying their best to do something. This often but not always boils down to learning by imitation or by repetition. If a person thinks understanding is measured by intuition, then the person would try to develop intuition. If a person thinks understanding is measured by the ability to explain, then the person would try to develop ways to explain that concept to self and others.

For me, I like to spend time developing intuition by reiterating things in my mind. Thus, the second sense of understanding comes naturally to me. I spent most of my life using the definition that I understand something when I can sense it as natural and intuitive.

Recently, as I studied Discrete Math with Prof Orrison, I got the chance to write a lot of proofs in detail. He would always remind the class that the most important thing in this class is clarity and understanding. During that time, I adopted the third definition of understanding that I need to be able to explain something in order to say that I understand it. At first, this is very hard, it means that I have to first admit that I don’t understand many things I used to say I understand. Furthermore, finding a way to explain a concept to other people is a hard thing to do in general. It takes more time and energy from me, but I believe that it is worth it for many reasons:

1.	It allows me to think about knowledge with clarity. If I think about knowledge in terms of how it should be explained, I will often think about it in steps I would need to derive that knowledge. By thinking about the knowledge step by step, I will gain better understanding about the context of knowledge and how it works. It would be much harder to make leap or skip necessary parts if I have to explain this knowledge to other people. As a person with ADHD, I do not have much innate clarity. My ideas are generally extremely muddled. However, I see that when I think about knowledge in terms of how I would explain it, such knowledge become much clearer for myself. It allows to focus better and think more clearly. It seems as if I can make up for clarity in my brain with clarity in ideas.
2.	It allows me to learn from others more easily. When I can express my current knowledge in a clear way, somebody who wants to teach me new knowledge can easily work from my background and use what I already know as a foundation for the new knowledge.
3.	It allows me to teach others more easily obviously. 
4.	It is easy to prove that I have some kind of knowledge. If I have some kind of knowledge, I should be able to explain it to you. If I cannot explain it in a satisfactory way, then it is likely that I don’t actually have such knowledge.
5.	It allows me and others to criticize my understanding. If I can express my own understanding in a clear language, then it would be much easier for me to spot a mistake in my thinking. This allows me to examine and criticize my own knowledge. For others to spot a mistake in my thinking, it is necessary that they first understand what I think. If I cannot explain what I think, then it is impossible for others to spot mistakes in my ideas.
6.	This form of understanding is humble and altruistic. The only way that I can claim that I have some knowledge is for me to share it with others. Such mindset acknowledges knowledge as fluid, exchangeable, and abundant, rather than being fixed and innate in oneself or one group of people.

To me, these advantages make the third definition of understanding—that one understands when one can explain it to others—the most useful one. I think this is the kind of understanding that people actually look for.
